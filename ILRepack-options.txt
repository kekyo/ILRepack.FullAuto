IL Repack - assembly merging using Mono.Cecil - Version 2.0.18
Syntax: ILRepack.exe [Options] /out:<path> <path_to_primary> [<other_assemblies> ...]
 - /help              displays this usage
 - /keyfile:<path>    specifies a keyfile to sign the output assembly
 - /log:<logfile>     enable logging (to a file, if given) (default is disabled)
 - /ver:M.X.Y.Z       target assembly version
 - /union             merges types with identical names into one
 - /ndebug            disables symbol file generation
 - /copyattrs         copy assembly attributes (by default only the primary assembly attributes are copied)
 - /attr:<path>       take assembly attributes from the given assembly file
 - /allowMultiple     when copyattrs is specified, allows multiple attributes (if type allows)
 - /target:kind       specify target assembly kind (library, exe, winexe supported, default is same as first assembly)
 - /targetplatform:P  specify target platform (v1, v1.1, v2, v4 supported)
 - /xmldocs           merges XML documentation as well
 - /lib:<path>        adds the path to the search directories for referenced assemblies (can be specified multiple times)
 - /internalize       sets all types but the ones from the first assembly 'internal'
 - /delaysign         sets the key, but don't sign the assembly
 - /noRepackRes       do not add the resource 'ILRepack.List' with all merged assembly names
 - /usefullpublickeyforreferences - NOT IMPLEMENTED
 - /align             - NOT IMPLEMENTED
 - /closed            - NOT IMPLEMENTED
 - /repackdrop:RepackDropAttribute allows dropping members denoted by this attribute name when merging
 - /allowdup:Type     allows the specified type for being duplicated in input assemblies
 - /allowduplicateresources allows to duplicate resources in output assembly (by default they're ignored)
 - /zeropekind        allows assemblies with Zero PeKind (but obviously only IL will get merged)
 - /wildcards         allows (and resolves) file wildcards (e.g. *.dll) in input assemblies
 - /parallel          use as many CPUs as possible to merge the assemblies
 - /pause             pause execution once completed (good for debugging)
 - /index             stores file:line debug information as type/method attributes (requires PDB)
 - /verbose           shows more logs
 - /out:<path>        target assembly path, symbol/config/doc files will be written here as well
 - <path_to_primary>  primary assembly, gives the name, version to the merged one
 - <other_assemblies> ...

Note: for compatibility purposes, all Options are case insensitive, and can be specified using '/', '-' or '--' prefix.
